## Block Header

- **version**: Fixed value, e.g., 1.
- **previous_block_hash**: Dummy value, e.g., "0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000".
- **merkle_root**: A hash calculated from concatenating the txids.
- **timestamp**: Current Unix timestamp.
- **difficulty_target**: Fixed value, e.g., "0000ffff00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000".
- **nonce**: A value found during mining to satisfy the difficulty target.

## Serialized Coinbase Transaction

- **txid**: A unique identifier for the coinbase transaction.
- **vin**: Input of the coinbase transaction, typically contains special coinbase data.
- **vout**: Output of the coinbase transaction, with a predefined reward.

## Transaction IDs

- A list of the transaction IDs included in the mined block, starting with the coinbase transaction's ID followed by other valid transaction IDs.

---

Note that the actual values (like txids, timestamps, nonce) will differ based on the specific transactions processed and the mining outcome. This example is meant to illustrate the expected structure and content of the `output.txt` file.
