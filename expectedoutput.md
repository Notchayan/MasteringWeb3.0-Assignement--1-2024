## Explanation of Each Section

### Block Header
Contains metadata about the block including version, previous block hash, Merkle root, timestamp, difficulty target, and nonce.

- **version**: Block version (e.g., 1).
- **previous_block_hash**: Hash of the previous block, using a dummy value here.
- **merkle_root**: Root hash of all transaction IDs concatenated.
- **timestamp**: Unix timestamp of block creation.
- **difficulty_target**: Predefined target for block mining.
- **nonce**: Value found through mining to satisfy the difficulty target.

### Serialized Coinbase Transaction
Special transaction that rewards the miner.

- **txid**: Unique identifier for the coinbase transaction.
- **vin**: Input of the coinbase transaction, containing special coinbase data.
- **vout**: Output of the coinbase transaction, specifying the reward value and script.

### Transaction IDs
List of transaction IDs included in the block.

- The first transaction ID is the coinbase transaction ID.
- Following IDs are for valid transactions mined in the block.

Ensure that when generating the actual `output.txt` file, the placeholder values (...) are replaced with the real transaction IDs and values derived from processing the transactions and mining the block.
